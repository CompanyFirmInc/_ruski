Meeting with Head of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin,"February 20, 2021",10:00,"President of Russia
Vladimir Putin: Mr
Rogozin, let us have an in-depth discussion on the corporation’s performance in 2020. The issues we will discuss include carrier rocket launches, the state of the orbital group, your plans, fundamental space research, and, of course, the financial
indicators. Please, go ahead.General Director of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin: Mr President, last year we posted good results overall. For a second
year running since 1993, there were no accidents. This is certainly a positive
indicator – I hope we will continue in the same manner – of improved discipline
in the sector as a whole and the reliability of our rocket and space
technology.We have launched 17 space mission rockets, and the Defence Ministry launched seven combat missile systems. This is 24 launches
altogether, and all of them were successful. Many launches have been postponed
until this year, mostly the commercial missions of our partners who stopped
their production facilities in Europe last spring, and so we had no payload to launch. But we will complete these missions this year.Vladimir Putin: How many launches did you complete?Dmitry Rogozin: Seventeen plus seven.Vladimir Putin: And how many do you plan this year?
29?Dmitry Rogozin: We plan to launch 29 space missions
alone. This is because of the missions we could not accomplish last year.Moreover, we plan to complete several important
missions. For example, we will resume a lunar exploration programme after a 45-year pause. In October, a Luna-25 moon lander will be launched from the Vostochny Space Launch Centre. And after that, as you are aware, we will
increase robotic Moon studies, to be followed by a manned mission, which I will
report on today.Next, we will send two modules to the ISS. They
have already been delivered to Baikonur. We are completing their electricity
tests and plan to launch the largest of them, the Nauka multipurpose lab
module, in May.One of the important launch missions is, of course, the ongoing trials of the Angara carrier rockets. As you know, we
resumed their flight trials in December. We have ensured all the technical
specifications the state
customer wants. This
year, we plan to launch one heavy-duty and two light Angara rockets. We will
subsequently increase the number of launches. In this context, we are expanding
the production at our Polet facility in Omsk, where serial production of the Angara
rockets should start in 2023, meeting the requirements of both the Defence
Ministry and Roscosmos for these heavy carrier rockets. Another important mission planned for this year
is the launch of a space-borne imaging radar. This is our first radar project.
To see how important this is, just take a look at the Northern Sea Route.
Rosatom is developing the NSR as an operator, and we view it as a unique
transit route. However, to be able to use its eastern part from Yamal to the Pacific Ocean, we must see everything that takes place there. There are extremely
dense fogs in that region, and so traditional remote Earth probing satellites cannot
reliably monitor the ice situation there. But a space-borne radar can detect
the smallest detail round the clock, in winter or dense fog. We are actually
creating navigation maps for the captains of our icebreakers escorting cargo
ships, who will be able to use them to choose the best route in real time.Therefore, I believe that we are going to have
a very busy but also very interesting year in this sense.We have definitely approached the start of a new manned programme. The Orel spacecraft, which I have reported to you about,
is a new strategic manned mission that can deliver up to four persons to the Moon. We will start its static tests right away, in February. In other words,
it has been fully assembled, in metal, and we are working on the test
programme.The socioeconomic orbit group comprises 89
spacecraft. This year we started introducing new GLONASS satellites.Vladimir Putin: How many of them do you have in orbit?Dmitry Rogozin: We have 28 GLONASS craft, 23 of which are in orbit, with the rest either undergoing tests under the supervision
of the chief designer, or having been put on standby. When a satellite’s service
time runs out, the one on standby takes over. And the last spacecraft of the previous
generation, GLONASS-M, is on earth. The GLONASS-K2 and GLONASS-K vehicles have
an increasing share of Russian-made electronics. Mr President, just as I promised, by 2025 our GLONASS vehicles will be 100 percent Russian-made, as stipulated in the import substitution programme.Vladimir Putin: And their service time will
increase.Dmitry Rogozin: Yes, of course, up to 15 years, at the least. As it is, they are even now working longer than their service time.
This is good. As I said, if one of them shuts down, we have stand-by vehicles
on the ground and in orbit, but these aircraft have proved to be extremely
reliable.Vladimir Putin: What about their accuracy? Dmitry Rogozin: Their accuracy is 2.6 metres, and they cover 100 percent of the Earth’s surface. Of course, they show better
results in the northern hemisphere, because the group has been configured like
this, but the new-generation GLONASS-K2 satellites and the development of ground-based infrastructure, that is, signal calibration systems, will allow us
to improve accuracy to 1.3 metres in the next few years. This is good.Vladimir Putin: This is very important for transport,
especially for maritime transport.Dmitry Rogozin: Yes, this is very important. Mr
President, it is extremely important that all types of vehicle, including
aircraft and maritime transport, brought into Russia in any possible way, be it
leasing or purchase, are equipped with the GLONASS system.Vladimir Putin: Tell me about your financial
performance.Dmitry Rogozin: Our financial results are as follows: the cash execution of the budget is 94 percent, and execution of the state defence order, 100 percent. By and large, we are gradually decreasing our
overdue receivables. Overall, our revenue was roughly the same as the year
before, but our revenue due to output diversification has increased
dramatically. The delivery of power equipment produced at our plants has almost
doubled to 12 billion rubles. In other words, we are not selling the surplus of our production – we repurpose such production, just as you instructed. In fact,
acting within the framework of the anti-sanctions policy, we now deliver pump
turbines and various reinforcing bars to Gazprom and Gazprom Neft, gas
compressor units to the Amur Gas Processing Plant, and so on. This important
project is proof of our diversification and the sector’s development as a whole.Of course, I would like to say the following
about our engine manufacturer Energomash, especially since you have recently
visited Khimki to open a transport interchange there, for which I am deeply
grateful because it was really a request of the Energomash staff. So, Energomash
as a holding company manufactures a large number of power units for our oil and gas producers.Vladimir Putin: What about your project in Moscow?Dmitry Rogozin: The [National Space Centre] project
in Moscow is ongoing, and I am ready to take you on a tour any time. We are
already building walls, that is, construction has reached the above-ground
level. We will start building the main facility soon. In principle, the Moscow
authorities promise to complete construction in late 2022 or 2023, and the final touches will be made in 2024, when we will settle down in the National
Space Centre. I am especially grateful to the Moscow Government for building
transport interchanges, opening new metro stations and building bridges across
the Moskva River to prevent traffic chaos. We are planning to move 8,000 workers from the Khrunichev Centre to the new building. At long last, the Salyut Design Bureau
will have not just jobs but high-tech work places for doing their highly
skilled jobs. I am actually dreaming about that day. My colleagues have asked
me to thank you for approving this project. In addition, 12,000 workers from
our other leading design bureaux in Moscow will move into the new building as well. As for the 90-hectare plot that has been left unused for a long time, we
are building a technopark there. It is our joint venture with Moscow, which
Roscosmos has joined on your instructions and where we now hold a controlling
stake. The Moscow companies that are working for the aerospace sector will be
located in the park with all the incentives and bonuses approved by the Moscow
authorities.Vladimir Putin: Good. <…>Published in sections: News, Transcripts  Publication date:    February 20, 2021, 10:00  Direct link: en.kremlin.ru/d/65041  Text version "

again in person, which is rare and very valuable under the present circumstances.Our interaction tools have been
running smoothly. We do not have a single day when our colleagues do not speak
to each other or resolve some particular issues that face them.But I am pleased to say that the level of interaction in our strategic partnership and alliance is being reaffirmed.
Russia remains Belarus’ biggest trade and economic partner at about 50 percent.
We are the largest investor: your Russian partners have invested over $4
billion in the Belarusian economy. We are pursuing large projects in energy. Suffice it to mention the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant, which, as we
know, is being successfully implemented. I would like to highlight that the President
of Belarus is personally focused on this major project. We are also working hard in our
traditional markets, including agriculture. Foodstuffs from Belarus enjoy great
popularity in Russia as they are invariably of high quality and normally fresh
and affordable. Of course, we have strong relations
in culture. There is actually no need to list our contacts. We are a very close
as people and nations. Culture, language, religion, a shared history which is
rooted not only in the fairly recent and heroic past during the Great Patriotic
War, but also goes back centuries, this is what unites us. And it is good that
we are encouraging these efforts today as well.I am happy to note that many young
people in Belarus choose Russian universities and colleges to study for their
careers and get a good profession.And lastly, interaction at the regional
level. Each year we hold meetings with the leaders of the regional administration
bodies. This work is crucial because the bulk of our relations has been built
up and continues to be built up at the level of regional interaction. This includes
economic ties and personal relations. These fairly extensive ties are
proceeding in the border regions exactly in this way – from person to person,
from one family to another.We have a lot of work on today’s
agenda. I am very glad to see you. Welcome.I hope we will be able to spend at least some time together and relax after today’s working hours, and I would
like to invite you to do some skiing.President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you, Mr Putin.You said the key phrase at the beginning,
that it is indeed rare that heads of state meet and speak privately these days.
I think we will keep this communication format running.Even our appearance – clothes and other things, serious talks in casual clothes – shows that we are close. Our
peoples are very close as well as our countries, so we can discuss serious
issues in any form.There is no need to invent anything – you and I have done a lot, and our governments have been working together up until
now. I think we have identified 33 areas; you remember the roadmaps we worked
out. During our first meeting in Sochi, we agreed to upgrade and modernise these
roadmaps, and our governments would work on this. The governments did indeed do very
much, both the Russian and the Belarusian governments. They upgraded the format, and Ambassador Semashko reported to me today that six or seven roadmaps
remain of the 33 that our governments are working on. These new roadmaps have different
names now after rebranding. Most are ready to be signed< so we have a plan.I am definitely very grateful to you
for the support you have given to the Belarusian economy. I should say that this
has been done for a good reason, it is not a waste of money. Belarus has a GDP
of about $70 billion, and as you said, about half of our foreign trade is tied
with Russia. We are Russia’s number four partner in terms of trade. It seems
like an average European country, yet it ranks fourth for giant Russia. So, you
can imagine how much raw materials and component parts from Russia we use in our $70 billion GDP. This is why I am thanking you. You
should know that you have not frittered your money away. We invest in back-end
production thus purchasing a tremendous amount of component parts and raw
materials from Russia,
and that amount is ever growing.If we implement all the planned projects
that we have approved for the coming five years, imports form the Russian
Federation will increase dramatically. Even though we will commission a nuclear
power plant, which would mean five billion less in natural gas purchasing, we
are set to build the Grodno nitrogen fertiliser complex, which also means
natural gas consumption; this is why we could still increase gas consumption. Vladimir Putin: One billion more. Alexander Lukashenko: Even slightly more than that.The new complex is estimated at $1.2
billion to $1.3 billion. We have experience in this area with a similar plant,
and it works for us; this is why we want to increase the output of nitrogen
fertilisers. We are ready to implement this project with Gazprom if you give the instructions. Thank you very much for access to education
and universities. Although we have a good level of education, young people proactively
apply to universities in the Russian Federation to secure a good education. I have one such young man in my family, as you know. We often discuss the coronavirus issue
and your achievements. I keep saying we also have some achievements in vaccine
production since Soviet times. But you already have three registered vaccines
and more in development. We are also on this track: we will have our vaccine by the autumn, we have specialists for that, but currently we are purchasing
yours. At home we often say the subject of vaccines testifies to the highest level of science in the Russian Federation.
But science does not exist without proper education. This has had a powerful
effect on our youth in terms of education in the Russian Federation. Meanwhile,
young people from Russia also come to us; thank God, we have no barriers here. Thank you for responding to my request and reopening rail traffic between our countries, increasing air
traffic and making it possible for citizens of both Russia and Belarus to travel
back and forth. I think soon we will also reopen automobile traffic. We have few problems with this; we are
not closed in this respect. Under our agreement, you sent in sent specialists,
and they found that the morbidity rates in our two countries were almost identical.
Luckily, the morbidity has begun to drop. We hope by autumn or even by summer we
will approach a zero rate. I am very grateful for the invitation, for a chance to be able to come to the mountains, even if only for a short time, and breathe fresh air in these tumultuous times. Thank you.Vladimir Putin: You mentioned financial support. You are absolutely right; this is
crucial but it is not the main thing. The key is working together and cooperating
in the real sector of the economy. Trade has indeed fallen somewhat during the epidemic, by about 15 percent. Nevertheless, it totalled $28.5 billion, which is a pretty big number, a considerable amount.As to our
joint efforts on fighting the coronavirus, this is progressing successfully. We
delivered the first batch last year, and the next deliveries are due in February and March. But most importantly, in my view, is that we are launching
it at your company…Alexander Lukashenko: We began production with your technology in March.Vladimir Putin: Absolutely correct. What is important is that the technology has been transferred. So far,
we have not closely cooperated this much with anyone…Alexander Lukashenko: It is substantial support. Without it, we would
have had trouble with vaccination.We have
already vaccinated almost all doctors, and now we are vaccinating teachers and retail workers – those
who have the most contact with people. This is why it is such substantial support.Vladimir Putin: And the overall result is, to put it modestly,
satisfactory. According to an objective indicator, we recently had 12 new cases
a day per 100,000 people
whereas now the number
is smaller, I believe, around 10. Alexander Lukashenko: The Russian vaccine is the most efficient one;
it is acknowledged throughout the world. It is the most efficient vaccine, no
matter how they troll and dig at it. Vladimir Putin: This is true.Alexander Lukashenko: Two or three people of every hundred of those
vaccinated can experience a mild illness. We had one person, I will not mention
his name, who fell ill after being vaccinated with the Russian vaccine. He was
sick for a day and a half altogether.Vladimir Putin: Right.Alexander Lukashenko: There was just one case.Vladimir Putin: It comes as a mild infection.But I meant to say that we have about 10 new daily cases per 100,000…Alexander Lukashenko: That is very little.Vladimir Putin: Whereas in the south of France there
are over 70 cases per 100,000 people. This is a disturbing number. Alexander Lukashenko: Of course. Vladimir Putin: You see, this is objective data, which says that we should join efforts with our European colleagues, among others. We
are trying to do that; we are open to cooperation. Our Gamaleya Centre has a contract with AstraZeneca. I am pleased to note that we will be joining efforts with our European partners
as well, we will be working together.And with Belarus – that
goes without saying. Let
me repeat, the technology has already been transferred, and according to the reports I receive, production is being rolled out.Alexander Lukashenko: You promised that Belarus would be
the first country, and you did this. Vladimir Putin: And it happened like that. Alexander Lukashenko: Thank you for this.<…>Published in sections: News, Transcripts  Publication date:    February 22, 2021, 15:30  Direct link: en.kremlin.ru/d/65046  Text version "

Meeting with Head of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring Yury Chikhanchin,"February 19, 2021",13:10,"President of Russia
Vladimir Putin: Mr
Chikhanchin, I would like to begin our meeting with matters pertaining to the organisation
of monitoring and control of budgetary funds flow. I understand that there will
be many more subjects to discuss, but I suggest that we begin with this particular
one.Head of the Federal
Service for Financial Monitoring Yury Chikhanchin     Chikhanchin YuryHead of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring : If I may ask you, please take a look at these
slides.Mr President, first of all, I would like to say
that we have already launched, by and large, a mechanism for monitoring and controlling the flow of budgetary funds. Treasury and anti-monopoly support,
monetary support at the customs and tax service, banking support and our
monitoring mechanism have already been introduced. Together with the ministries
and departments I have already mentioned, we are also working actively with the Government, in particular, with its Analytical Centre to create a system of assessing contract execution risks, regarding both contractors and customers, and mechanisms to reduce such risks.We are operating closely with the interdepartmental
working group on countering illegal financial transactions, the one you have
established, to coordinate joint measures for the cases at hand. As of today,
we are monitoring the flow of some 2.5 trillion rubles, some 36,500 contracts
and about 20,000 contractors and customers.What have we achieved in 2020 in terms of preventive measures? Working together with the Federal Antimonopoly Service, we
have identified some 270 cartel agreements, terminated contracts with mala fide
contractors worth some 29 billion rubles, and prohibited some 100 contractors
from working on contracts because they failed our inspections.The focus of our attention in terms
of national projects remains on roads, education and demography where, in our
opinion, the risks are high today.Regarding roads, we are currently
working with the Transport Ministry and are jointly assessing specific risks
and ways of minimising them. I believe that we will eventually work with other
ministries on this project. In an effort to directly thwart
criminal activity, we have helped open about 1,000 criminal cases; we have
located, impounded and frozen about 125 billion rubles. Violators have
voluntarily handed in 5.5 billion rubles, and more than 20 billion rubles has
been returned to the budget. While assessing the overall
mechanism, I would like to note what we have accomplished. In the past two
years, the number of fly-by-night companies has plunged about five-fold, due to our joint efforts. Cashing in of money is down 35 percent, and capital export has
decreased three times over. We intend to work at both the federal
and regional levels. We are working very closely with a number of regions, in particular the Novgorod and Tula regions. For example, we have exposed
kindergarten construction contracts in the Republic
of Khakassia where prices were overstated two-fold. With the Prosecutor General’s Office, we are now
investigating the contracts and those who ordered them. Vladimir Putin: Khakassia? Yury Chikhanchin: Yes,Khakassia. I would like to say a few words about several national projects.We are working to prevent
and thwart violations in healthcare.In terms of preventing
violations, we have achieved specific results on some criminal cases. We have
persuaded authorities in Bashkortostan to cancel a contract for building a surgical facility, and its dishonest executor is now listed among other mala
fide executors. A similar situation has shaped up in the Stavropol Territory
where we have cancelled a contract worth 1.5 billion rubles. Unfortunately, we
have also opened criminal cases regarding a tuberculosis hospital for children
in Vladikavkaz and some medical centres in Novosibirsk. We are now focusing particularly on the funds allocated to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. In conjunction with the Central Bank, we have developed a number of criteria and introduced a special
code number, which the banks use to inform us about suspicious transactions
involving these funds. This allowed us to identify a crime in the Irkutsk
Region. The regional healthcare minister was arrested, and 30 million rubles in stolen funds has been seized as well. Much the same kind of work is underway in St Petersburg. I am referring to the construction and retrofitting of medical
centres. A certain affiliation was spotted there, and we are looking into it in conjunction with the Prosecutor General’s Office.I would also like to discuss several
demography-related issues. In particular, we are now working, in conjunction
with the FSB, the Interior Ministry and the Investigative Committee, on a case –
trade in infants under the guise of surrogacy maternity services. I believe
this is bad for our demography.Second, we have exposed criminal
groups involved in prostitution and human trafficking. On the second issue, in addition to our colleagues from Russia’s law enforcement agencies, we are also working
with Turkey and the UAE to track down the beneficiaries and participants of these dealings.There is a similar situation regarding
the environment. I would like to cite the following example: in conjunction
with the FSB, the Interior Ministry and the Federal Agency for State Property
Management, we are now working to stop the misappropriation of state property,
in particular, mineral water wells in the North Caucasus. I think they will
return to the state soon.Vladimir Putin:
Good.Yury Chikhanchin: With regard to the social sphere, I would like to draw your attention to the following: after people started receiving pandemic-related benefits, certain
‘law firms’ began to make money out of it. Now, in conjunction with the Interior
Ministry, the Prosecutor General's Office and the Investigative Committee, as well as the Moscow Government and the Moscow Region Government, we have exposed
several such companies, and they have been closed. The Prosecutor General's
Office is currently checking about 30 companies.We continue to keep track of property
transactions, especially the ones involving easy-term mortgages.I would like to say a few words about the state
defence order. In general, we have seen proof of the wisdom of your decision to create a system of monitoring the state defence order. Working together with
the Defence Ministry and law enforcement agencies since the law came into
effect, we have reduced the number of fly-by-night companies in the sphere of state defence orders by 37 percent and the number of shady transactions by some 40 percent. Overall, the number of suspicious
transactions has been reduced to one-third. Of great assistance in this respect
are the banks that have been assigned to work with the state defence order,
first of all Promsvyazbank. It should be pointed out that the number of the bank’s transactions involving state defence orders has increased by approximately eight times and the number of clients has more than tripled.Regrettably, crimes have been committed in the sphere of state defence orders. Based on our information, over 120 criminal
cases have been instituted, damages worth 9 billion rubles exposed, 2.4 billion
rubles seized, and 1.5 billion rubles paid back voluntarily. We are now working
with the Federal Security Service (FSB) on several schemes involving the state
defence order.Vladimir Putin: As far as I am aware, one of them
involves splitting up contracts, followed by asset stripping.Yury Chikhanchin: Yes, we see that large contracts
are being split up into smaller ones, which makes them more difficult to monitor. We are working closely together with the FSB on this scheme.I would like to say a few words about
individual sectors, in particular, forestry.The situation has been gradually changing
during the past two years, and the law enforcement agencies have become more
active in this sphere. We are working together with the FSB, the Interior
Ministry, prosecution offices and the Investigative Committee, and much more
energetically after the State Council meeting devoted to forestry.Vladimir Putin: So, it was not in vain?Yury Chikhanchin: Work is ongoing especially actively
in Siberia, in particular in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, under the guidance of the plenipotentiary envoy. Criminal cases have been opened in the Tomsk and Irkutsk regions, including corruption-related ones. The proceedings launched in the Far East and the Urals have to do with the smuggling of timber. Efforts in the Northwestern Federal District are designed to identify foreign
beneficiaries involved in these shady schemes.We continue working in the fisheries sector, where over 30 criminal cases have been opened with our
assistance. I would like to say a few words about the ‘crab case’, the high-profile one. We continue working on it; over 20 proceedings have been
initiated, and we are now investigating foreign involvement together with our
financial intelligence colleagues in Japan, South Korea, Europe and the United
States. I believe we will find the money and hand it to the state.Vladimir Putin: You mean customs duties and tax
arrears?Yury Chikhanchin: Yes, tax and other arrears.I would like to spend a moment
discussing the energy industry. Here too, work is underway in conjunction with
the FSB, the Interior Ministry, the Prosecutor General's Office, the customs
and the Ministry of Energy, focusing primarily on the companies that abuse trust,
raise tariffs and send money abroad. About 100 criminal cases were initiated in 2020, damages amounted to 11 billion rubles, and 9.5 billion rubles were seized.
Most importantly, the Ministry of Energy believes that these efforts made it
possible to limit increases in tariffs. This, of course, will relieve some social
tensions.I would like to say a few words
about combating corruption. Again, in conjunction with law enforcement
agencies, primarily, the Prosecutor General’s Office, we identified the most important
corruption-prone areas which include federal and municipal procurement, state
property and budgetary funds. Corrupt officials can be found wherever there are
affiliations, preferences and conflict of interest.What is our work based on? Primarily,
it includes suppression and preventive measures. Here, in conjunction with the Presidential Executive Office, anti-corruption commissions at the ministries
and a panel of judges, we checked over 75,000 civil servants who are currently employed
or seeking employment. Several hundred applicants for public posts have been denied
employment based on our materials.In terms of suppression, we have
conducted over 5,000 financial investigations and opened about 500 criminal
cases in which we are involved. We have exposed assets worth 35 billion and have
already recovered assets worth 38.5 billion in corruption cases.I would like to say a few words
about combating drug trafficking. Here, we are working on the financial
component with the State Anti-Drug Committee, in conjunction with the Interior Ministry,
the FSB and the prosecution service, as well as our colleagues from other
countries. Usually, drugs come from abroad and money goes abroad as well. We are
now working with over 30 financial intelligence services as part of just one
case. Criminal cases have been initiated with our participation in a number of countries, in particular, Belarus, Moldova and Spain.We are facing the following risks. Drug
traffickers use electronic payment systems and cryptocurrencies. In conjunction
with law enforcement agencies and the Academy of Sciences, we have first of all
developed a digital service that allows us to analyse crypto transactions. This
enables us to track cryptocurrency transactions and, most importantly, we are
now working on attributes and criteria which could allow us to single out crimes
amid the flow of transactions. Criminal cases have been opened. We are working
closely with our colleagues from other countries, such as Finland (financial
intelligence), Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Belarus, Malta and others. This
project is monitored by the Government, and the Ministry of Digital Development
is helping us see it to completion this year.I would like to say a few words about working
with financial institutions. They are the main providers of information for us,
and the situation is as follows. We have drafted 13 bills with the Central
Bank, which were adopted into laws and enacted. The operation of eight shadow platforms
has been curbed. The share of high-risk banks decreased by about 60 percent;
some had their licenses revoked, others were punished in other ways. Banks have
applied the criteria they had helped develop to prevent the misuse of about 190
billion – from being either channelled into suspicious transactions or withdrawn from the legal economy. The volume of suspicious transactions has
been reduced by more than half over the past two years.But the underworld is casting about for new
mechanisms. We have ousted them from banks, so because they have no chance with
banks, they are using notary services – have notaries sign various transactions.
A new law has been enacted, allowing notaries, from 2021, to refuse to notarise
transactions they find suspicious. Last year, they identified such transactions
worth about 25 billion.Fraudsters also continue using the judicial
system for illegal purposes, such as attempts at false bankruptcy.Vladimir Putin: To secure court decisions, right?Yury Chikhanchin: Yes. Promissory notes, bankruptcies,
things like that.We have taken part in more than 5,000 court
hearings as a third party with total claims exceeding 600 billion. And I must
say that this work is yielding results: about every tenth case, the court rules
against the applicant, and this again means we have prevented the misuse of about
70 billion through the courts.Because people’s incomes have dropped somewhat,
various firms have emerged that offer ways to make quick money. In particular, we
have worked together with the Bank of Russia, the Prosecutor General's Office,
the Interior Ministry and the FSB to terminate the activities of a foreign
company, Antares Limited, which offered investment in cryptocurrency.We are working with our colleagues from nine
countries to identify the beneficiaries; the suspicious website has been blocked.
We are now figuring out how much money has been withdrawn, how, who, and how many.
This happened in the Siberian Federal District and in the Far East.In the European part of Russia, we have
encountered a slightly different approach. Some pseudo-brokers were selling various
financial services. We joined forced with the Prosecutor General's Office, also
with the Bank of Russia and our colleagues from abroad (from about a dozen
countries, in particular Cyprus, Estonia, and Finland helped us), and we
identified about 350 foreign websites, and Roskomnadzor (the Federal Service for Supervision
of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media) blocked
them.Vladimir Putin: Are foreign online platforms also
used here?Yury Chikhanchin: Yes. They are doing the same thing.
In both the first and second case, the people are based abroad, and they cannot
even be traced.I would like
to mention our efforts against the financing of terrorism. We are working in this sphere primarily under
the guidance of the National Anti-Terrorist Committee. Working together with
lending institutions based on the methods we have developed with the FSB and the Interior Ministry, we have exposed over 2,300 private individuals and over
1,000 legal entities suspected of being involved in terrorism-related financial activity. We have
frozen the assets of over 1,200 individuals and 1,600 legal assets in non-judicial procedures within the framework of the interagency commission that
has been set up at your instructions. Twenty foreigners have been denied entry
into Russia and over 250 terrorism cases have been opened, including 150 that
are related to financing of terrorism. Working together with our colleagues in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, we have identified some
1,200 persons involved in terrorism and have frozen their assets as well.We are working
together on concrete cases involving the local cells of international terrorist
organisations. I would like to say that together with the Interior Ministry,
the FSB and our Turkish colleagues, we have picked up the financial trail and the persons who were involved in the terrorist attack in Istanbul in 2017. A criminal case has been opened in Turkey and in Russia with our assistance.In addition to what I have already said, I would like to draw your attention to the following
risks. We are working hard to minimise the risk of sanctions that may be
imposed by foreign countries and international organisations against private
individuals and legal entities. There are two possible ways.First of all,
we are working with other members of the anti-money laundering system to prevent criminal and suspicious funds from being transferred to foreign
countries where they can be used as a reason for investigation by financial
intelligence and other security services and, subsequently, for sanctions.And second, if
we fail, we try to join forces with our foreign colleagues to settle each
particular case without any delays. If we find elements of a crime, we transfer
the relevant materials to our law enforcement agencies for launching criminal
proceedings. If not, we try to prove that this is ordinary business activity
and that no legal action needs to be taken against our private individuals or legal entities. As a rule, we find common ground with our foreign colleagues,
who accept our opinion.What tools are we using to resolve
these problems? First of all, this is a personal account of oversight bodies.
It is being used by several dozens of thousands of financial and non-financial organisations
that supply us with information. We transfer online information on any new
risks, new typologies and new crimes and they quickly respond by sending us quality
information. This is on the one hand. On the other hand, we are seeing how law
abiding they are: each of them has a panel with several segments that show if
they are violating anything by switching on a red signal. As a rule, they
quickly correct any mistakes and we do not have to visit financial
organisations to check up on them. This works remotely.And second, we are now launching a personal account of law enforcement agencies that also work online: exchange
information on the operational environment, respond to specific inquiries and situations, and receive training. I think we will try to integrate all the law
enforcement agencies in this system in 2021 and later government bodies that
are involved in the anti-laundering system.We are closely cooperating with our
International Learning and Teaching Centre that allows us to teach the public
and increase its financial literacy. We educated 1,500 civil servants and more
than 26,000 experts on financial institutions. We are also training our foreign
colleagues, primarily from the Eurasian group and the CIS: Belarus, India,
Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. We
provided education for over 2,000 people.We are also using out International
Network Institute that has 40 educational institutions from seven countries.
They have the same educational programmes, the same manuals we compile and give
to our colleagues. We are writing them in cooperation with them as well. We
have about 4,000 students from 30 countries. These are our tools. Now we are actively working to increase
financial literacy of the population together with the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry. Needless to say, we are primarily working with our foreign
colleagues. There is plenty that we are doing. I would like to thank you very much
for supporting the creation of the International Centre for Assessing the Risks
of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism. The Government has allocated additional
funds for us and I think we will launch this mechanism with our CIS colleagues
fairly soon. This is how we worked in 2020 and plan to work in 2021, if you support us.Vladimir Putin:
Ok.“Transparent blockchain” – what is
it?Yury Chikhanchin: “Transparent blockchain” is exactly the mechanism that will allow us
to see all the movements of cryptocurrency, and expose any attempts to hide
behind it. It is ostensibly inaccessible, and makes it possible to hide the true beneficiary but I think this mechanism will let us reveal everything.Vladimir Putin:
That’s good.<…>Published in sections: News, Transcripts  Publication date:    February 19, 2021, 13:10  Direct link: en.kremlin.ru/d/65036  Text version "
